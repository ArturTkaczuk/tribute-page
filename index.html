        <h2>Here's a short biography of Ben Graham</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Benjamin Graham was born in London in 1894. His original name was
          Grossbaum, but he changed it as a young man, to better fit into the
          Wall Street environment.<br /><br />

          His parents moved to New York City when he was one year old. Graham
          was a brilliant student and won a scholarship to Columbia University.
          In 1914, he graduated second in his class, at age 20, and was invited
          to teach at the school. But he refused. His father had died, the
          family was poor, and Graham needed a larger income to support the
          family.<br /><br />

          So he went to Wall Street and worked for the firm of Newburger,
          Henderson and Loeb for $12 per week.<br /><br />

          His early duties included being a runner, delivering securities and
          checks, writing descriptions of bond issues, and later writing the
          daily market letter of the firm. Before long, he began to analyze
          companies, and at the age of 26 he was promoted to full partner.<br /><br />

          In 1923, he left to set up his own partnership, and in 1928 he began
          teaching investment classes at Columbia.<br /><br />

          Over time, working with former student David Dodd, the lessons of his
          classes were gathered into his first book, titled “Security Analysis,”
          which was published in 1934.<br /><br />

          The book has sold over a million copies. Warren Buffett says he’s read
          it at least four times. He was a student of Graham’s in the 1950’s
          when he enrolled in graduate school at Columbia, and he learned well.
          In fact, Buffett has often said that after his father, Benjamin Graham
          was the most important influence in his life. He even wrote the
          forward on the sixth edition. Buffet may have read the book four
          times, but I’ve only read mine once (it’s the second edition,
          published in 1940, with 851 pages), but it remains a valuable
          reference. You can buy it for around $50 on Amazon.<br /><br />

          Or, you could simply read Graham’s second book, the more user-friendly
          “The Intelligent Investor,” which was published in 1949 and is less
          than half the size of its predecessor.<br /><br />

          Benjamin Graham passed away in 1976 at the age of 82.<br /><br />

          “The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable
          optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism
          (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist
          who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.”<br />
